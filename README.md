**Introduction:**

We have created from existing code, our version of the old game, Pac-Man.

In this ReadMe document, we will specify our 2 extensions to this assignment, as requested.

**Our GitHub IO:**

**Functionality appended:**

We have chosen to add functionality in the shape of pills, that will help Pac-Man survive and win

as many points as it can!


**#1**

**Chill Pill -** a pill that will help Pac-Man in the time of danger. It will collect the pill when

it can, and ghosts will not be able to attack it for 8 seconds.

To help recognize the start and the end of the situation – ghosts will be painted blue.

After this amount of time, ghosts will be painted back to the original color and will be

able to attack Pac-Man again.


**#2**

**Slow Pill –** a pill that will damage ghosts in the time of danger of Pac-Man. It will collect

the pill when it can, and ghosts will be slowed significantly for a duration of 5 seconds.

Meanwhile, this will give Pac-Man a huge opportunity to collect many points.

After this amount of time, ghosts will have back the same speed as before.
